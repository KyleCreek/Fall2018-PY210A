Notes for Session 02
####################

A collection of notes to go over in class, to keep things organized.

Lightning Talks

Are you ready? We'll do them in the middle of the session.

Class Outline
=============


git / gitHub
============

In general, most of you seem to have got the basics down:

 - creating a new file
 - adding it to git
 - pushing it to your fork of the class repo
 - making a "pull request" on gitHub.

Any conceptual questions?


Exceptions
==========

Most of you seemed to do fine making the few key exceptions -- any questions?

**Note:**

We were not expecting you to catch the exceptions -- we're really starting at the bottom here, just making sure you get used to seeing Exceptions, and what they mean.

We'll get into Exception handling later.


Coding Bat
==========

Anyone stuck on any of them?

Anyone not like their solution?

Let's talk about it!
